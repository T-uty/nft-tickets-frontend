        <p>
          NFTs are unique digital tokens stored on a blockchain. Once they are
          created on the blockchain, they can be sold to customers digitally.
          Customers then store NFTs in a secure wallet that they can access on
          any device. In the ticketing system, event organizers can mint the
          required number of NFT tickets on their choice of a blockchain
          platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          They can code the NFTs to set a sale price or run the sale as an
          auction where people can bid for tickets. A buyer purchases NFT-based
          tickets directly from the ticketing company. On receiving payment, a
          smart contract triggers and a ticketing database sends an NFT ticket
          to the buyer. The ticketing company requests to upload the ticket on
          the IPFS.
